Try this example online: https://try.metalama.net#autoconfigureawait.

This code exists only for the purpose https://try.metalama.net, but does not represent the recommended way of creating
an aspect weaver. In a real situal, you would have the weaver logic in a separate project, and all classes would not be
in the same file.

See [the Metalama.Open.AutoCancellationToken repo](https://github.com/postsharp/Metalama.Open.AutoCancellationToken) for
that.
