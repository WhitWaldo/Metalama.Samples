# Contributing to Metalama Examples

These examples are all released under an open-source MIT license.

If you have built an original aspect, please consider sharing it with the Metalama community.

The procedure is the following:

1. First chat with us on [Slack](https://www.postsharp.net/slack) to see if we like the idea. It's better to be disappointed now than after you went through the whole procedure.
2. Fork the `Metalama.Samples` repo.
3.  Create a subdirectory under the `examples` directory.
4. Create a .NET 6 console project with your aspect, all helper classes of your aspect, and an executable project that demonstrates the aspect.
5. Optionally, create an aspect test project under the `examples/tests` directory.
6. Create a `README.md` explaining the objective of your aspect and the most important points of interest in the documentation.
7. Submit a pull request to the `Metalama.Samples` repo.
8. The rest of the procedure will probably happen on GitHub or  [Slack](https://www.postsharp.net/slack).

We are looking forward for your contributions!
