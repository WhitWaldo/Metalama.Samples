# Example: The simplest logging

[!metalama-project-buttons .]

This example is the _Hello, world_ of aspect-oriented programming. We will create an aspect that displays a message when a message starts and completes. In the following example, the code in green is generated by the aspect.

[!metalama-file Program.cs transformed]

Let's look at the aspect that generates this code:

[!metalama-file LogAttribute.cs]

This aspect is probably the most basic. It has however a few points of interest:

* The `LogAttribute` class derives from the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.OverrideMethodAspect> abstract class, which in turn derives from the <xref:System.Attribute?text=System.Attribute> class. This makes `LogAttribute` a custom attribute.

* The `LogAttribute` class implements the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.OverrideMethodAspect.OverrideMethod*> method. This method acts like a _template_. Most of the code in this template is injected into the target method, i.e. to the method to which we add the `[Log]` custom attribute.

* Inside the <xref:Metalama.Framework.Aspects.OverrideMethodAspect.OverrideMethod*> implementation, the call to `meta.Proceed()` has a very special meaning. When the aspect is applied to the target, the call to `meta.Proceed()` is replaced by the original implementation, with a few syntactic changes to capture the return value.
  
  To remind you that `meta.Proceed()` has a special meaning, it is colored differently than the rest of the code. If you are using Metalama Tools for Visual Studio, you will also enjoy syntax highlighting in this IDE.
