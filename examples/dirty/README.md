# Example: Dirty flag

[!metalama-project-buttons .]

The _Dirty Flag_ pattern is a design pattern used to track changes to an object's state by maintaining a boolean flag that is set to true whenever the object's properties or fields are modified. This pattern is commonly used in user interface programming or database operations, where it is necessary to quickly determine whether an object's state has changed and take appropriate action.
