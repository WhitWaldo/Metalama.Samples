# Example: Logging

This series of examples have a single goal: to build an aspect that writes a message before and after any targeted method is executed.

We start from the most trivial implementation and progressively add features:

1. [Logging a constant message](log-101/README.md)
2. [Adding the method name](log-102/README.md)
3. [Adding the parameter values](log-103/README.md)
